Artemis Financial



Client Summary and Software Requirements
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that manages sensitive customer and transaction data. They wanted to boost their software’s security to protect this information from online threats. The main challenge consisted of finding vulnerabilities in the system and applying accepted security practices to lower risks and build trust.

Strengths in Recognizing Vulnerabilities and Importance of Secure Coding
I did well identifying security weaknesses and clearly documenting them in the vulnerability assessment. I focused on encryption, dependency vulnerabilities, and protected communication. Writing secure code is important because it protects sensitive data, lowers breach risks, and keeps buyer trust. Good security also helps companies avoid financial losses, legal problems, and reputation damage.

Challenges and Helpful Parts of the Vulnerability Assessment
The hardest part of the vulnerability assessment was interpreting automated security scan results and deciding which findings were real risks and which were false alarms. Still, this process helped me better understand how vulnerabilities are found and ranked in real software systems.

Increasing Tiers of Security and Future Assessment Methods
I added more security layers by using stronger encryption, protecting data during transfer, and fixing known dependency vulnerabilities. In the future, I plan to keep using tools like dependency-check scanners, static code analysis, and security tools to find vulnerabilities. These tools help choose the best ways to reduce risks.

Ensuring Operation and Security After Refactoring
To make sure the application stayed functional and secure after refactoring, I tested it after implementing changes and checked the updated security scan results. This confirmed that the changes didn’t break anything or create new vulnerabilities. Running scans again after refactoring was key to confirming the security improvements worked.

Resources, Tools, and Practices for Future Work
The resources and tools I used in this project, like dependency-check reports, secure coding guidelines, and encryption best practices, will be helpful in future assignments. These practices point out the importance of producing clean, secure code and regularly checking software for known vulnerabilities.

Artifacts to Present to Future Employers
For future employers I will highlight the vulnerability assessment and secure software best practices report created for this work. These documents demonstrate my ability to analyze software security risks. Use risk reduction strategies and clearly record findings It also reflects my understanding of the important role of secure coding in professional software development.
